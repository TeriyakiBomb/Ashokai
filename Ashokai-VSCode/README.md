**Ashokai** is a mixture of the awesome Nebula theme, Monokai and a bit of Catppuccin to boot. Colourful and contrasty, this set of themes aims for good quality highlighting for most common languages.

### Ashokai - Creamy beige

A warm, light beige variant. A bit like Bailey's. In fact, it's as close as you can get to Bailey's without getting your eyes wet.⋆
