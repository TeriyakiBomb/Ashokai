\section*{Notes for My Paper}

Don't forget to include examples of topicalization.
They look like this:

{\small
\enumsentence{Topicalization from sentential subject:\\
\shortex{7}{a John$_i$ [a & kltukl & [el &
  {\bf l-}oltoir & er & ngii$_i$ & a Mary]]}
{ & {\bf R-}clear & {\sc comp} &
  {\bf IR}.{\sc 3s}-love   & P & him & }
{John, (it's) clear that Mary loves (him).}}
}

\subsection*{How to handle topicalization}

I'll just assume a tree structure like (\ex{1}).

{\small
\enumsentence{Structure of A$'$ Projections:\\ [2ex]
\begin{tabular}[t]{cccc}
    & \node{i}{CP}\\ [2ex]
    \node{ii}{Spec} &   &\node{iii}{C$'$}\\ [2ex]
        &\node{iv}{C} & & \node{v}{SAgrP}
\end{tabular}
\nodeconnect{i}{ii}
\nodeconnect{i}{iii}
\nodeconnect{iii}{iv}
\nodeconnect{iii}{v}
}
}

\subsection*{Mood}

Mood changes when there is a topic, as well as when
there is WH-movement.  \emph{Irrealis} is the mood when
there is a non-subject topic or WH-phrase in Comp.
\emph{Realis} is the mood when there is a subject topic
or WH-phrase.

\medskip
This is a sample file in the text formatter \LaTeX.
I require you to use it for the following reasons:

\begin{itemize}

\item{It produces the best output of text, figures,
      and equations of any
      program I've seen.}

\item{It is machine-independent. It runs on Linux, Macintosh (see {\tt TeXShop}), and Windows (see {\tt MiKTeX}) machines.  There are web-based versions, \href{https://www.overleaf.com}{\tt https://www.overleaf.com}.
     You can e-mail {\tt ASCII} text versions of most relevant files.}

\item{It is the tool of choice for many research
     scientists and engineers.
     Many journals accept
     \LaTeX~submissions, and many books
     are written in \LaTeX.}

\end{itemize}
\medskip
Some basic instructions are given next.
Put your text in here.  You can be a little sloppy    about
spacing.  It adjusts the text to look good.
{\small You can make the text smaller.}
{\tiny You can make the text tiny.}

Skip a line for a new paragraph.
You can use italics ({\em e.g.} {\em  Thermodynamics is everywhere}) or {\bf bold}.
Greek letters are a snap: $\Psi$, $\psi$,
$\Phi$, $\phi$.  Equations within text are easy---
A well known Maxwell thermodynamic relation is
$\left.{\partial T \over \partial P}\right|_{s} =
\left.{\partial v \over \partial s}\right|_{P}$.
You can also set aside equations like so:
\begin{eqnarray}
du &=& T\ ds -P\ dv, \qquad \mbox{first law.}\label{fl}\\
ds &\ge& {\delta q \over T}.\qquad  \qquad \mbox{second law.} \label{sl}
\end{eqnarray}
Eq.~(\ref{fl}) is the first law.
Eq.~(\ref{sl}) is the second law.
References\footnote{Lamport, L., 1986, {\em \LaTeX: User's Guide \& Reference Manual},
    Addison-Wesley: Reading, Massachusetts.}
are available.
If you have a postscript file, say {\tt sample.figure.eps}, in the same local directory,
you can insert the file as a figure.  Figure \ref{sample}, below, plots an isotherm for air modeled as an ideal gas.
\begin{figure}[ht]
\epsfxsize=2.5in
\centerline{\epsffile{sample.figure.eps}}
\caption{Sample figure plotting $T=300~{\rm K}$ isotherm for air when modeled as an ideal gas.}
\label{sample}
\end{figure}

\medskip
\leftline{\em Running \LaTeX}
\medskip

You can create a \LaTeX~file with any text editor ({\tt vi}, {\tt emacs}, {\tt gedit},
etc.).
To get a document, you need to run the \LaTeX~application
on the text file.  The text file must have the suffix ``{\tt .tex}''
On a Linux cluster machine, this is done via the command

\medskip
{\tt latex file.tex}

\medskip
\noindent
This generates three files: {\tt file.dvi}, {\tt file.aux},
and {\tt file.log}.  The most important is {\tt file.dvi}.

\medskip
\noindent
The finished product can be previewed in the following way.
Execute the commands:

\medskip

{\tt dvipdf file.dvi}\hspace{1.9in}{\em Linux System}

\medskip
\noindent
This command generates {\tt file.pdf}, which can be viewed with many standard tools.
Alternatively, you can use {\tt TeXShop} on a Macintosh or {\tt MiKTeX} on a Windows-based machine. {\em Another very good and modern option is the web-based} \href{https://www.overleaf.com}{\tt https://www.overleaf.com}.
The {\tt .tex} file must have a closing statement as
below.
